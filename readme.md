## Directions to implement the code
* Create a virtual environment: virtualenv -p python3 <env_name>
* Activate the environment: source <env_name>/bin/activate
* Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file.
* Put the train, test, and validation data in the dataset folder. The dataset folder already contains the claim descriptions embeddings from RoBERTa. 
* Run python daberta.py to run the code.
* The model for each epoch will get saved in the models folder.
